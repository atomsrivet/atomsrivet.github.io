## Research 

My research investigates how the structure and order of information affects how humans and artificial neural networks learn about the world and make decisions. My work combines large data from experiments in gamified environments and computational modelling to shed light on the information processing mechanisms in humans and artificial neural networks. 

My publications cluster around 4 main themes:

  <summary>
 1. <b> Context dependence in decision making. </b> How does the informational landscape –information that we have recently experienced– affect perceptual and economic decisions? </summary> 
 <br>
  My work has provided evidence on the computational mechanisms underlying context-dependent judgments, demonstrating that the influence perceptual distractors and decoy consumer products may arise due to a shared, efficient computational principle – neural adaptation (Dumbalska et al., 2022; Dumbalska et al., 2020), and that reference effects owe to changes in both how we experience (perception) and how we evaluate incoming information (judgment; Dumbalska & Smithson 2024). For this line of work, I received two research prizes: The Humphreys Prize for Best Research Project (University of Oxford) and the Pembroke College Senior Studentship.

   <ul><li>Here, we develop a method to shed light on the computational origins of reference dependence that have been subject to half a century of controversy. Our work combines psychophysics with computational modelling to arbitrate between influences on the level of perception, judgment and action. </li></ul><br>

   <ul><li>Here, we provide evidence that perceptual distractors modulate choices in a way that depends on their similarity to target stimuli (interaction effect), as opposed to wielding an independent influence on choices (independent effect). We accounted for these effects in an efficient coding framework, appealing to neural normalization, via computational modelling.</li></ul><br>

   <ul><li>Here, we took a novel approach to studying decoy effects: rather than sampling a subset of stereotyped values (as in existing studies), we charted the full “decoy influence map”, by exhaustively measuring the influence of a decoy stimulus D(i,j) with attributes i and j on choices between two choice targets.</li></ul><br>

 2. <b> Representation learning. </b> How does the the structure and order of learning opportunities –termed curricula in education and machine learning– affect learning outcomes and neural representations? </summary> 
  <br>
  My research has charted how balancing conceptual and strategic complexity during training can lead to accelerated and more successful learning (Dumbalska et al., 2023). As part of this line of work, I have collected large-scale data from >15,000 participants world-wide charting learning progression on a gamified task (<a href="https://atomsrivet.github.io/roomworld/index_game.html">demo</a>).

  <ul><li>Here, we show that organizing learning opportunities such that participants can practice new concepts in increasingly complex mental operations boosts learning progress and outcomes.</li></ul><br>

 3. <b> Value alignment. </b> How do we ensure that artificial agents' objectives are aligned with human values? </summary>
<br>
  My current research investigates value alignment in open source reward models and the potential influence of human biases on alignment in a standard RLHF setting.

 4. <b> Open Science. </b> How do we enhance the transparency and reproducibility of scientific research? </summary>  <br>
  I am actively involved in the open science movement and initiatives to increase the transparency and reproducibility of research results. I have contributed to two pieces of written evidence for policy on Reproducibility and Research Integrity for the UK Government (entries 20210930 and EGYJ106500), several open science publications and computational reproducibility projects.
