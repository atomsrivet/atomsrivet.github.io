      Before running the task, we will require you to read, understand and agree with a consent form, read carefully the guidelines describing what you will have to do.
    </p><p>
      Additionally, we need to ask you to <b>run the whole task in fullscreen</b> and focus exclusively on the task you are about to do. This is very important - so please close all "chat" applications, games, etc. At any time before you get your verification code, <b>if you leave the fullscreen mode, the task may be cancelled!</b>
    </p><p>
      If the task is cancelled or you run into any technical issues, contact us at hiplab@psy.ox.ac.uk and <b>do not restart the task</b>. This is important because it's a learning experiment, and restarting the experiment may affect its outcome.
    </p><p>
      In general, if you have any issues or questions, please put yourself in contact with hiplab@psy.ox.ac.uk and let us know what happened. Don't forget to specify the task you are running (see the title of this website).
