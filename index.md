## About 

My research focuses on how we learn about the world and make decisions. In my doctoral thesis, I investigated why seemingly irrelevant contextual information can sway what we choose when faced with perceptual and economic decisions. My research showed that a relative mode of information processing, grounded in neural normalization, can explain the rich map of contextual influence of economic decoys, perceptual distractors and temporal reference frames. By encoding information in this relative fashion, the brain can boost computational efficiency.

My current work in the Human Information Processing laboratory centers on the interplay of learning and choice. In the real world, we often face new and unfamiliar settings and situations. We use contextual information to learn about the current environment and evaluate the possible courses of action -- we scaffold our choices on knowledge acquired from the context. My research charts how contextual information shapes learning and choice through experimentation in gamified model environments with human volunteers and computational modeling.
