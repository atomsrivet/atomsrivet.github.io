## About

I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Oxford. My research focuses on how humans and artificial agents learn about the world and make decisions. I am particularly interested in how the structure and order of information affects judgment and inference. You can learn more about my research and publications <a href="/research">here</a> and my teaching and service <a href="/teaching_service">here</a>.

<br>
Before this, I completed a BA in Economics at Brown University and a DPhil (PhD) in Experimental Psychology at the University of Oxford. My <a href="/thesis">doctoral work</a> investigated why irrelevant contextual information can often sway our choices. Outside the lab, you can find me roller blading or jogging in nature and savoring a good book over some iced tea.
