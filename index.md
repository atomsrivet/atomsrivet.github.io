I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Oxford. My research focuses on how we learn about the world and make decisions. To study this, I conduct experiments with human volunteers with (hopefully) fun, interactive games like <a href="/effugium">this one</a>. I use quantitative approaches to analyze and model the data, including artificial neural networks and reinforcement learning.

Before this, I completed a DPhil (PhD) in Experimental Psychology at the University of Oxford investigating why irrelevant contextual information often sways our choices. You can find an online version of my doctoral thesis <a href="/thesis">here</a>.
