## About

My research focuses on how we learn about the world and make decisions. In my doctoral thesis, I investigated why seemingly irrelevant contextual information sways our choices. Depending on context, the exact same alternatives might lead to different decisions. This happens both when we make simple perceptual judgments and when we make more abstract, value-based choices. But changing our mind based on irrelevant information can lead us to make suboptimal decisions. And so the context dependence of human decision making poses a puzzle:  why has evolution sculpted the neural system in a manner that would reduce the apparent accuracy of our judgments? My research showed that by encoding information in a relative fashion, the brain can boost computational efficiency. This mode of information processing explains the rich map of contextual influence observed in human behavior. 

My current work centers on the interplay of learning and choice. In the real world, we often face new and unfamiliar settings and situations. We use contextual information to learn about the current environment and evaluate the possible courses of action -- we scaffold our choices on knowledge acquired from the context. My research charts contextual influence on learning and choice through experimentation with human volunteers and computational modeling.
