I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Oxford. My research focuses on how we learn about the world and make decisions. To study this, I conduct experiments with human volunteers with (hopefully) fun, interactive games like <a href="/effugium">this one</a>. I use quantitative approaches to analyze and model the data, including artificial neural networks and reinforcement learning.

Before this, I completed a DPhil (PhD) in Experimental Psychology at the University of Oxford under the supervision of Prof Hannah Smithson and Prof Christopher Summerfield. My doctoral work investigated why irrelevant contextual information often sways our choices. You can find my doctoral thesis <a href="/thesis">here</a>.
