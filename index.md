## About

My research focuses on how we learn about the world and make decisions. In my doctoral thesis, I investigated the puzzle of context dependence in human choices. Seemingly irrelevant contextual information can sway our decisions across the realm of perception and economics. Depending on the context, the exact same alternatives might lead to different choices. This often reduces the accuracy of our judgments. Why has evolution sculpted the neural system in a manner that leads us to suboptimal choices? My research showed that by encoding information in a relative fashion, the neural system can boost computational efficiency. This mode of information processing can explain the rich map of contextual influence observed in human beahvior. 

My current work centers on the interplay of learning and choice. In the real world, we often face new and unfamiliar settings and situations. We use contextual information to learn about the current environment and evaluate the possible courses of action -- we scaffold our choices on knowledge acquired from the context. My research charts contextual influence on learning and choice through experimentation with human volunteers and computational modeling.
