## Teaching and Service

### Teaching
As part of my lecturer position in Brasenose College, I lead small group teaching for first and second year undergraduate students. I hold teaching accreditation for Descriptor 1 of the UK Professional Standards Framework (PSF) for Teaching and Supporting Learning in Higher Education (HEA Associate Fellowship). 

Previously, I have been involved in teaching in various capacities at the University of Oxford, including lecturing (computational psychology and decision making), tutorial teaching (statistics, cognition, perception, social psychology), demonstrating in practical classes (graduate-level programming and undergraduate visual neuroscience, perception, cognition and psychology of economics classes) and coordinating teaching activities for a visiting students program in Pembroke College. 

I have provided research supervision over the last 5 years, including 7 undergraduate final year research projects, 2 research internships for undergraduate students from marginalized backgrounds via the Wellcome BVS and UNIQ+ programs, and 2 graduate projects.


### Service
I am deeply committed to creating an inclusive, supportive community for everyone. I believe in direct anti-racist action and have co-organized a University-wide discussion group on Decolonizing research. I have supported College- and University-led EDI initiatives, including the OxNet access summer school and the UNIQ+ research internship programme. 

At the departmental level, I chair the departmental Early career researchers committee and have previously served as a representative on the departmental Diversity & Equality and People & Culture committees, as well as on collegiate committees in a variety of roles. 

I have served as a welfare officer and am a trained peer supporter. My service work has been recognized with awards for service to the community including the the W. H. Pembroke Prize Service to the community and awards for contributions to Career Development and Research Culture in the Department in Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford.
